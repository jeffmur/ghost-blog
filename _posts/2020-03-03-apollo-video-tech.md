Formally Apollo Video Technology, where I had the pleasure of working with dedicated professionals at [Luminator Technology Group](https://www.luminator.com/en) who sparked my interest in Networking and Security based solutions. I gained so much hands-on experience and knowledge from our lead [Stanislav Krasnyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skrasnyi/). His perseverance and management skills kept the project on track and pushed our team through the finish line.

We developed an proof of concept to decode live streaming video on mobile devices. <br>
- Authentication Flow
- Websocket H264/5 Video Stream
- Decoding within WebView Flutter Plugin
- WebView Layered Architecture
- Synchronous & Asynchronous Network Calls

Such that we could mimic their web portal one camera at a time!
